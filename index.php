                An acid–base titration is a method of quantitative analysis for determining the concentration of an acid or base by exactly neutralizing it with a standard solution of base or acid having known concentration. A pH indicator is used to monitor the progress of the acid–base reaction.

               An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron, or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair. The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids.

               In chemistry, bases are substances that, in aqueous solution, release hydroxide (OH−) ions, are slippery to the touch, can taste bitter if an alkali,[1] change the color of indicators (e.g., turn red litmus paper blue), react with acids to form salts, promote certain chemical reactions (base catalysis) , accept protons from any proton donor or contain completely or partially displaceable OH− ions Examples of bases are the hydroxides of the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals (NaOH, Ca(OH)2, etc.—see alkali hydroxide and alkaline earth hydroxide).

               A titration is a technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution. Typically, the titrant (the know solution) is added from a buret to a known quantity of the analyte (the unknown solution) until the reaction is complete.

       <p><h4><strong>IMPROVEMENT:-</strong></h4>
       <h6>We can improve our project by including more acid’s strength so that we can prepare many more acid of wanted solution in our lab. And we also make is useful not only for titration and measurement of volume of acid but also for many other calculations which we face in the lab in regular basis. As we all become dependent on machines day by day, in this time this kinds of tool is really required to make us more perfect, so hopefully we can make it more useful and more important for us.</h6>
